# Skin-disease-classification
An image classification project with CNN to classify six types of skin diseases.

In this project I will make a CNN model based on Inception V3, then I will also explore the effects of adding dense layers and dropout layes. The dataset consists of 1652 images scraped from Google Image's top results for 'Atopic dermatitis', 'Herpes', 'Lyme disease', 'Poison ivy', 'Psoriasis', and 'Rosacea'.
